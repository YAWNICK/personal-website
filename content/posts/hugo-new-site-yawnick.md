There's got to be an initial post. This is really just here to have at least one unit of content so that I can move on from this Meta-project of a personal website to actual projects / endeavours that might appear here as content.

I'm not exactly sure what this site will turn out to be, so here's a probably incomplete list of things that might happen in the future:
- Computer science related posts appear
- Posts about other topics appear
- A list of projects appears
- The theme changes
- The site is abandoned (hopefully not)
